Today is my first day of traning in SDC. I was window user but here is mandatory to work on `Linux`. So i have put the `Linux` in my laptop. All training members are talking about `frappe` which i never heard before. From them i got some idea aboout the `frappe` framework and read some little bit documentation of `frappe`.

### Day-2 (30-7-2022)

Today I made a bootable usb drive by downloading the Linux ubuntu ISO in that and the running it on my machine (laptop).
The very next task was to install the lamp on the linux ubuntu and hosting a localhost asthe test result, this was initially giving some problems in the installation.but then at last was just able to run all the commands fro teh installation and the problem then came was to host it locally some commands which were optional of the php were also executed by me.

We have two options:
`First`: We can add a custom button in the cmc request form using the form script. 
The link which is following is: https://frappeframework.com/docs/v13/user/en/api/form But here we have an issue of permissions. Because Custom button is not a field in a doctype and in my knowledge we are only able to gives permissions to doctype fields to show that fields to some specific users so here.

So we are going towards the `second` option is:-
We can create a field which is of type `Button`. I know this is a silly question but how can we add links behind the Button type fields in frappe?? I searched this on Google and found that we need to write custom scripts to make this button working. But I didn't get the correct syntax for this.

### Day-61 (6-10-2022)

we have checked that if we select items for estimate then it will also reduces in stock. So when our stock becomes completely empty then we need to send quotations for required items. So now our next task is to send quotations and restore our stock again.

#### Day-133 (15-12-2022)

I fixed the error that was going to happen yesterday today.The domain of doctype was causing an error.We must choose the domain in which the doctype will be saved while creating it.Next step i took forward towards the project which is that create a new doctype with all mandatory information which contains all mandatory information regarding trainees. I created a webform of this doctype, which is filled out by the instructor when students express a desire to join the SDC training. The student will then be eligible for a certificate at the end of the training.For that, we have created a webpage with the name "trainees. We created a webform of this doctype, which is filled out by the instructor when students express a desire to join the SDC training. then at the end of the training, the student will be eligible to get a certificate. For that, we have created a webpage with the name "Certificates." The instructor will generate the certificate by clicking on "Certificate" in the /me directory. It will generate the certificate for the respective trainee automatically.
